BuildOrder problem as 'solution.txt'.
I have used only STL here. Although this problem can be solved in an alternate way by making graph from build Packages followed by Topological sort.

Used C++11 standard and assumed input file named as "inputBO.txt" and kept on the same folder as of program(solution.txt)

Compilation & run command : go to the folder->convert solution.txt to solution.cpp->compile ->run :
cd "<path for program>" && mv solution.txt solution.cpp && g++ solution.cpp -o solution && "<path for program>\"solution

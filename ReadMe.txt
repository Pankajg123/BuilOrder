BuildOrder problem solved in C++  without using  Graph Topological sort . Only Used STL. Unique way as everywhere it is solved by graph.
Used C++11 standard and assumed input file named as "inputBO.txt" and kept on the same folder as of program(solution.txt)

Compilation & run command : go to the folder->convert solution.txt to solution.cpp->compile ->run :
cd "<path for program>" && g++ solution.cpp -o solution && "<path for program>\"solution
